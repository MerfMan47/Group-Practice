=================Notes=================
THis problem is very similar to the
LeetCode #1 problem. I have completed
the #1 problem quite a while ago only
using an array and an algorithm instead
of a bracket notation object and a 
for-of loop. Still this is a good way
to complete this problem.
=================Notes=================
// Given an array of numbers, return all pairs that add up to a given sum. The numbers can be used more than once. LeetCode #1

// describe("Two Sum", () => {
//  it("Should implement two sum", () => {
//   assert.deepEqual(twoSum([1, 2, 2, 3, 4], 4), [[2, 2], [3, 1]]);
//  });
// });
