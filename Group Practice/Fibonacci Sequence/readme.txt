This program is designed to generate
the nth term of the Fibonacci 
Sequence. This was another group
practice problem but it was rather
simple with only a single loop as
the next term of the sequence is the
prevous two terms added. I'm also
working on makeing an algorithm to
generate the nth term in linear time
complexity but I haven't got it quite
working yet.
